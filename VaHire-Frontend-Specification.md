## Authentication Flow

Implement Auth0 integration with the following flow:
1. User clicks Sign Up/Login
2. User chooses email/password or social login (Google, LinkedIn, etc.)
3. User completes Auth0 authentication
4. On successful authentication, send token to backend at `/api/auth/auth0-callback`
5. Backend creates/updates user and returns user data
6. Frontend stores token and user data
7. If user profile is incomplete, redirect to profile completion page
8. Once profile is complete, redirect to dashboard
